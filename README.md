# Node.js Topics Repository

This repository contains introductory materials and code examples for various Node.js topics. Each topic is covered in a separate file, providing a comprehensive overview of the respective subject matter. The following sections outline the contents of this repository:

## Introduction to Node.js

In this section, you will find a brief introduction to Node.js and its key features. It covers the basics of Node.js, such as its runtime environment, event-driven architecture, and non-blocking I/O model. This serves as a good starting point for beginners who are new to Node.js.

## REPL vs. Command Line

This section explores the differences between REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) and the command line interface in Node.js. It explains how REPL provides an interactive environment for executing Node.js code snippets, whereas the command line interface allows you to run Node.js scripts directly.

## Modules in Node.js

The module system is a fundamental aspect of Node.js. This section delves into the concept of modules, their role in organizing code, and how to create and use modules in Node.js. It also covers the CommonJS module specification and the built-in `require` function.

## File System (fs) Module

The File System (fs) module in Node.js provides functionality for interacting with the file system. This section offers an in-depth exploration of the fs module, including reading from and writing to files, working with directories, and handling file-related operations asynchronously.

## Operating System (os) Module

The Operating System (os) module in Node.js provides methods for interacting with the underlying operating system. This section covers various aspects of the os module, such as retrieving system information, managing processes, working with network interfaces, and more.

## Path Module

The Path module in Node.js provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. This section explains the key features of the path module, including path normalization, joining and resolving paths, extracting file extensions, and manipulating file paths.

## HTTP Server

Building an HTTP server is a common use case in Node.js. This section guides you through the process of creating an HTTP server using Node.js, handling requests and responses, routing, and implementing various HTTP methods.

## Event Emitter

The Event Emitter is a powerful feature in Node.js that allows you to create and handle custom events. This section introduces the Event Emitter pattern, demonstrates how to use it in Node.js applications, and showcases common use cases for event-based programming.

Feel free to explore each file to gain a comprehensive understanding of the respective topics. Happy coding!
